- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Accessibility-first approach (WCAG compliant)
- Modern CSS features (`:has()` selector, `color-mix()`)

### Key learnings

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Comprehensive form validation with JavaScript, including real-time error feedback
- Accessibility best practices for form elements, including proper labeling, focus management, and screen reader compatibility
- Implementing custom radio buttons and checkboxes with CSS while maintaining accessibility
- Using the `<dialog>` element for modal interactions with proper focus trapping
- Creating responsive layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox for optimal user experience across devices
- Managing complex form states (error, success, loading) with JavaScript
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming and easier maintenance
- Modern CSS techniques like the `:has()` selector for parent-level styling based on child state
- Performance considerations with local font loading and asset optimization
